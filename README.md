Introduction

Backpropagation is a key algorithm used in training feedforward neural networks. It plays an essential role in reducing errors by adjusting weights based on the propagated error. This project demonstrates backpropagation and gradient descent using the Iris dataset, a popular dataset for classification problems.

Dataset: The Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Each sample has four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Why the Iris Dataset?

It is a well-structured and balanced dataset.

It is commonly used in machine learning and classification problems.

It allows for easy visualization and interpretation of classification performance.

How Backpropagation Works

Backpropagation is used to adjust the neural network’s weights to minimize the error between predicted and actual values. The process includes:

Feedforward propagation: Compute the output by passing inputs through the network.

Calculate error: Compute the difference between predicted and actual output using a cost function.

Backward propagation: Adjust weights using the gradient descent algorithm to minimize the cost function.

Update weights: Use the computed gradients to update the weights iteratively until convergence.

Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that helps minimize the error in backpropagation by adjusting weights. It follows these steps:

Compute the gradient of the cost function.

Determine the direction of descent.

Update weights using the learning rate (alpha, α).

Repeat until convergence.

Types of Gradient Descent

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) - Updates weights after each training example.

Batch Gradient Descent - Uses the average of all training samples.

Mini-Batch Gradient Descent - Uses small random subsets of the dataset for updates.
